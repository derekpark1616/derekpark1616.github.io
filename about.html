		<h1 id="intro">Hi, I'm Derek!
		<br><br>
		I am a recent graduate looking to begin my career as a Software Engineer</h1>
		<br>
		<p id="aboutMe">My work experience is primarily in front-end web development (AngularJS) but I am more than willing to learn
		more about back-end and full-stack development of any technology. Learning new languages and
		frameworks is very gratifying and I like to spend significant portions of my free time doing so; most recently
		I've been learning Ruby from Flatiron's online school and hope to become proficient with Ruby and Ruby on Rails within 2017.
		In more leisurely moments I like to spend time with friends and play volleyball. If you'd like to know more please
		feel free to browse through any of the links above or simply send me an email at 
		<a href="mailto:derekpark1616@gmail.com" id="email">derekpark1616@gmail.com</a>

		Thanks for visiting! <i class="em em-smile"></i>
